Timeseries with Classical and Deep Learning techniques


**[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Time_series&oldid=1166537753&action=edit):**

In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. 
Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. 
Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Examples of time series are heights of ocean tides, 
counts of sunspots, and the daily closing value of the Dow Jones Industrial Average

**[Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)](https://it.mathworks.com/discovery/lstm.html#:~:text=A%20long%20short%2Dterm%20memory,between%20time%20steps%20of%20data.):**
A long short-term memory network is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN). 
LSTMs are predominantly used to learn, process, and classify sequential data because these networks 
can learn long-term dependencies between time steps of data. Common LSTM applications include sentiment analysis,
language modeling, speech recognition, and video analysis.
